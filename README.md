# LCAAJ

The Language and Culture Archive of Ashkenazic Jewry (LCAAJ) is an extraordinary resource for research in Yiddish studies,
consisting of 5,755 hours of audio tape field interviews with Yiddish speaking informants collected between 1959 and 1972 
and ca. 100,000 pages of accompanying linguistic field notes. The Archive does not include transcriptions of the interviews.

The data that constitutes the LCAAJ was collected from 603 locations in Central and Eastern Europe carefully chosen to 
reflect the distribution of the Yiddish speaking population on the eve of World War II. In a series of interviews lasting 
anywhere from 2.5 to 16 hours, informants answered questions on a wide variety of topics concerning Yiddish language and 
culture. The project was designed by Professor Uriel Weinreich, then Chairman of Columbia University's Department of 
Linguistics, and continued after his death in 1967 under the direction of Dr. Marvin Herzog, Atran Professor Emeritus of 
Yiddish Studies at Columbia University, who donated the Archive to the Columbia University Libraries in 1995. Dr. Herzog 
passed away in 2013.

Thanks to a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a two-year project is now underway to digitize and make 
available the transcripts for the LCAAJ. 

This codebase serves two purposes: first to clean the digitized transcripts from the LCAAJ and format the data in a way
that makes it accessible to those outside Columbia University. Second, once the data is cleaned and formatted, it will be
used for a variety of web based projects such as mapping and dictionary tools.

For the time being, this project is not seeking outside contributions, though that may change in the future.
